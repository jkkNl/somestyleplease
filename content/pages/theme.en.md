Almost no CSS, super fast and clean template for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) based on [hanwenguo/hugo-theme-nostyleplease](https://github.com/hanwenguo/hugo-theme-nostyleplease).

## Why I made this template
I wanted to keep the design minimalist and attractive, but change the logic and add some more color schemes.

## Features
* Super fast (**~8 KB CSS!**)
* Multi-language support
* Multiple color schemes (light, dark, matrix, bear, together, and auto based on system preferences)
* Responsive, focused on good content presentation (typography and maximum readability)
* RSS (with multi-language support)
* MathJax support
